## Understanding snowplow-python-tracker

Add analytics to your Python apps and Python games with the
[Snowplow](http://snowplowanalytics.com) event tracker for
[Python](http://python.org).

With this tracker you can collect event data from your Python-based
applications, games or Python web servers/frameworks.

This is a fork of the original Snowplow Python tracker v0.8.0, with a number of changes:

    -   All emitters except for the basic one removed
    -   Tests converted to docker
    -   All tracking event methods except for structured/unstructured
        removed
    -   Python 3.7 supported
